# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
Low background noise for working.  Best location: classroom! Work during class time, and stop at 3:00, etc.

## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
Let's work together! Reading ahead of time is great, but we can save the work time til we're together!

## Learning Style
Checking in if things don't make sense. We want to practice driving and navigating: driver will focus on listening (except for things we are both comortable with)
- high level for things we're comfortable
- navigator more detailed for things we're new to

## Preferred Feedback Style
Ask before giving feedback "Are you open to feedback?"
Timing: Give feedback within a day or so of the occurance.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Milena: listen more than talk
LP: Ask questions if I don't understand!  Sit back and not need to type all the time (realize that I can learn even when not typing code.)

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
